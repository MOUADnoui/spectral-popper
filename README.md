**StructureLang Runtime 4.0: Structural Planning, Collapse Detection, and Language Explanation**

---

## Overview

This repository implements an integrated testbed for the [StructureLang](https://your-link-here) language engine. It demonstrates how ψ-paths (resonance-based structural units) can be:

- Automatically generated and scored
- Compiled into predictive structural functions
- Evaluated for semantic viability via δ(x)
- Repaired under collapse
- Interpreted in structural language form

This test unifies the three central properties of a language that thinks:

1. **Recursive Planning**  
2. **Structural Falsifiability** (Popper test)  
3. **Language Explanation** (NLP-style output)

## Test File

### `test_runtime.py`

This script performs:

- ✅ ψ-path generation (`generate_path(N)`)
- ✅ Truth score validation (`validate(path)`)
- ✅ Residual monitoring (`observe_delta`)
- ✅ Collapse detection and repair (`is_collapsing` + `repair`)
- ✅ Structural sentence output (`explain_path`)

---

## Sample Output

```text
In domain x ∈ [200000, 300000], structure is supported by ψ1 ⊕ ψ2 ⊕ ψ3. Score: 0.00620
Collapse detected. Attempting repair...
Repaired path: [1, 2, 4]
In domain x ∈ [200000, 300000], structure is supported by ψ2 ⊕ ψ3 ⊕ ψ5. Score: 0.00420
