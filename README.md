## Introduction

The **Spectral Popper** project is designed for researchers and enthusiasts interested in the intersections of mathematics, computer science, and physics. Our focus lies in understanding complex systems through the lens of StructureLang. By experimenting with activation zones and hotspots, we aim to uncover new insights into computational theory.

## Features

- **Î´(x,t) Activation Zones**: Investigate how changes in activation zones affect system behavior.
- **Ïˆ-Hotspots**: Analyze critical points in the resonance spectrum.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilize cutting-edge algorithms to explore NP-completeness and GÃ¶del's theorems.
- **Visualizations**: Generate visual representations of findings to aid understanding.

## Installation

To get started with **Spectral Popper**, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MOUADnoui/spectral-popper.git
cd spectral-popper
```

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the main experiment script. This will initiate the exploration of Î´(x,t) activation zones and Ïˆ-hotspots.

```bash
python main.py
```

You can adjust parameters in the configuration file to tailor the experiments to your needs.
