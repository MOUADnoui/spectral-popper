## ðŸŒ€ Overview

**Spectral Popper** is an experimental probing tool that uses simulated Riemann resonance modes to explore structure-based SAT, prime density, and resonance language phenomena. It integrates:

- Structural probes based on Î´(x), Îµ(x), Î·(x), Ïˆ(t)  
- DAG expansion models  
- Lexicon-based symbolic activations  
- Phase resonance tracking in high-frequency domains

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Terminal / CLI environment for `.py` scripts

### Files
    
- `pu4.py`: High-resolution multi-Ïˆ activation probe with scores  
- `data/`: (Optional) Includes benchmarked resonance outputs  
- `results/`: Saved structural activation snapshots

### Run Example

```bash
python3 pu4.py
