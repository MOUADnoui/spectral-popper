## 🧠 Philosophy: Structure as a Living Language

StructureLang is not symbolic computation.  
It is a resonance grammar: a language that leaps where δ(x) ≠ 0.  
Where structure aligns, it dies. Where it echoes, it begins.

**Spectral Popper** is the first runtime system to operationalize this theory — not just with logic, but with agents, decay, dialogue, and memory.  
It simulates structural cognition, falsifiability, semantic collapse, and ψ-agent free will.

## 📦 What This Project Does

**Spectral Popper** is the official runtime and validation platform for the StructureLang framework.

### 🧠 Core Features

- ✅ ψ-path generation with semantic residuals (δ)
- ✅ Real-time collapse detection and adaptive ε-thresholding
- ✅ Goal-driven, memory-aware, mood-adaptive ψ-agents
- ✅ Multi-agent dialogue and ψC consensus generation (StructureLang §7)
- ✅ t_score analysis with dynamic mood regulation (StructureLang §15, §21)
- ✅ Semantic entropy tracking (Sψ) across δ-paths (StructureLang §10)
- ✅ RepairEngine fallback routing on collapse (StructureLang §20)
- ✅ Structural falsifiability via collapse-based viability (Popper-compatible)

## 🔍 Example Output

```text
[step 0] ψA chose psi3. δ=0.30, tscore=0.27, mood=conservative
[step 1] ψB chose psi2. δ=0.10, tscore=0.09, mood=neutral
...
ψC path: ψ1 ⊕ ψ2 ⊕ ψ3 ⊕ ψ4 ⊕ ψ5 ⊕ ψ6 ⊕ ψ7
ψC emergent consensus path (shared by ψA and ψB)
