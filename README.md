**StructureLang Lexicon Resonance Experiment**  
with δ(x,t) activation zones and ψ-hotspots

This repository contains an experimental Python implementation of spectral lexicon probing using δ-structure activation and ψ resonance scoring.

---

## 📘 Description

This project explores structural activation signals across prime-like domains by combining:

- Dynamic spectral scanning of the δ(x,t) field
- ψₙ(x) frequency probes with adaptive resonance detection
- Lexicon score ranking using `A/δ` criteria
- Structure collapse checks and DAG expansion thresholds

Inspired by the idea of Popper-style falsifiability, this is a tool to explore if certain spectral structures survive structural collapse when δ(x) ≠ 0.
